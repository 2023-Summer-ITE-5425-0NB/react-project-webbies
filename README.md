# Project Overview
The "Travel Guide" project is a collaborative effort developed by your group. It is a React application that serves as a comprehensive guide for travelers, providing valuable information, travel recommendations, and interactive features to enhance the travel experience. The project combines React components, API integration, CSS styling, and other functionalities to create a seamless and visually appealing user interface.

# Key Features
User-Generated Data:
The "Travel Guide" project includes the implementation of the user-generated data feature. Users can generate and manage their own travel data within the application. This feature allows users to input and store information such as personal details, preferences, or custom entries. The user-generated data is securely stored and can be accessed and modified as needed.

Language and Currency Conversion:
This functionality provides users with the ability to select their preferred language from a list of available options, dynamically translating the content of the application accordingly. Additionally, currency conversion tools enable users to view prices and perform transactions in their desired currency, catering to international travelers.

# CSS Styling

Your CSS styling ensures consistency, creating an engaging and intuitive interface. The styles are organized and modularized for easy maintenance and scalability.
